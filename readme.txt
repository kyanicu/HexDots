To run the game you need to host it locally
One way of doing this is:
- Ensure Node.js is installed on your system
- In a terminal run the command: npm install http-server -g
    - There may be an admnistrations error due to write access rights
- Navigate to the top directory (where this readme file is located) and run the command: http-server
- Open a browser and go to the address: localhost:8080
- Play the game!
